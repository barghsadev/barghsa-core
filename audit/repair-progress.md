# Repair progress

Baseline: `2f80d92df51556d47f778b5230e5eea577e2a8d4`. Work branch: `codex/audit-fixes`.
The original audit is preserved in this directory. Findings are checked against the implementation before repair. The feature scheduler remains paused.

## F01.1 Queue identity and requirement context

Implemented full payload and ordering validation, including type changes and unexpected fields. Existing notification and finance promotions are now explicit in `kanban/queue-priority.json`; the queue itself is unchanged. Both agents use the same extractor for all four task formats and receive the parent story requirements without sibling task bodies. The supervisor defaults to its own checkout rather than another machine's path.

Validation: all 31 Python tests passed; backlog check validated 1,355 tasks and 116 traceability entries. Tests cover payload mutation, reordering, duplicate/missing tasks, promotion rules, every current task's context, and existing review/merge gates.

Self-review caught the intentional priority order during the first regression run. It is preserved explicitly rather than being replaced with epic order. No live runtime state was changed.

## F01.2 Assignment ownership and state persistence

Implemented supervisor-owned assignments, separate strict builder handoffs, atomic external snapshots, append-only task events and a dedicated remote state branch with revision-checked push/readback. Added paginated PR reconciliation before builder dispatch. Stale idle identities, completed resumes, changed requirements and wrong handoff tasks cannot reach review. The documented three-fix limit now matches execution.

Generated `reconciled-loop-state.json` with 263 distinct merged identities and retained PR evidence. All 322 current audit claims and two retired identities have dispositions. The 57 historical skips without direct PR evidence remain deferred. No task is falsely certified acceptance verified.

Self-review found and fixed deeper infrastructure story headings and a task-ID boundary expression that could confuse an ID with a longer ID. Remote failure, stale writer, crash recovery and second-checkout recovery are exercised against disposable bare Git repositories. Live GitHub state publishing and the other machine's scheduler are untouched.

F01 still needs an explicit correction/recovery command and operational rollout after acceptance closure. The prepared state deliberately remains blocked. F02–F23 have not yet been implemented.

## F02.1 Production migration runner

The runner now reads schema-qualified Drizzle metadata, reports journal tags, verifies SQL checksums for the requested version, and distinguishes absent metadata from connection/permission errors. Each invocation owns and closes a direct pool. A connection-held advisory lock serializes competing deploys.

Validation: four PostgreSQL integration tests passed, covering first run, repeat run, competing deploys, failure rollback/retry, version checksum mismatch and connection failure. Database package typecheck passed. Docker became available during this repair, enabling real database tests.

The production migration chain remains under repair. Historical migration 0014 drops products with CASCADE and must not be replayed against populated databases. Existing helper-created tables also need a complete production baseline and upgrade evidence before F02 can close.

## F02.2 Complete schema baseline

Added a separate production migration chain that retains the historical journal and creates the full declared schema plus missing domain/foundation constraints. Production migration commands now use it; the base image copies its assets. Fixed 14 text/UUID reference mismatches and two defaults that prevented schema generation. Generation now succeeds through the TypeScript loader and reports no schema drift against the retained snapshot.

Validation: 73 database test files and 551 tests passed. All 11 workspace typecheck tasks passed. The production-path integration test installs and seeds an empty database, rejects orphan addresses and invalid wallet balances, enforces catalogue/default-profile protections, upgrades a populated legacy-journal fixture, preserves a 9,007,199,254,740,993 IRR balance and leaves prior migration records unchanged. The first full-suite run exposed the test's five-second limit under parallel load; this full installation/upgrade test now has a 30-second limit.

F02 still needs API/worker startup against this schema, wider runtime-query coverage and final image verification. Incompatible legacy rows require a reviewed backfill; the migration blocks rather than discarding or inventing data. F03–F23 are pending.
