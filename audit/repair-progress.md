# Repair progress

Baseline: `2f80d92df51556d47f778b5230e5eea577e2a8d4`. Work branch: `codex/audit-fixes`.
The original audit is preserved in this directory. Findings are checked against the implementation before repair. The feature scheduler remains paused.

## F01.1 Queue identity and requirement context

Implemented full payload and ordering validation, including type changes and unexpected fields. Existing notification and finance promotions are now explicit in `kanban/queue-priority.json`; the queue itself is unchanged. Both agents use the same extractor for all four task formats and receive the parent story requirements without sibling task bodies. The supervisor defaults to its own checkout rather than another machine's path.

Validation: all 31 Python tests passed; backlog check validated 1,355 tasks and 116 traceability entries. Tests cover payload mutation, reordering, duplicate/missing tasks, promotion rules, every current task's context, and existing review/merge gates.

Self-review caught the intentional priority order during the first regression run. It is preserved explicitly rather than being replaced with epic order. No live runtime state was changed.

F01 is still in progress. Immutable assignments, separate builder handoffs, durable remote state and reconciled task dispositions remain. F02–F23 have not yet been implemented.
